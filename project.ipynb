clip, switch the clip, then some more rounds\\nRappers fake and be hatin', I don't go 'round\\nI took 12 on a chase, I had four ounces\\nAsk around, we them guys, I do no clownin'\\nIf I can, I'ma try keep the smoke down\\nOnce it's up, then it's stuck, it can't go down\\nLike to switch where I sleep, I got four houses\\nEvery time the heat come, I make four thousand\\nBig done gave me the game and I ran with it\\nMilk the game 'til I quit, I ain't playin' with it\\nCould've been hit your bitch, I be sparin' niggas\\nMake me mad, I'ma call up them grave diggers\\nBought my mom a new crib, and it's way bigger\\nNever been to it once, that's a great feelin'\\nI'ma go there when I get a chance\\nI lost five hundred racks before I signed a deal\\nSwear to God, I still got my advance\\nYeah, I'm lit, I been savin' this guala up\\nYeah, I hit, but she didn't get a follow-up\\nAin't no reason to beef with no one about none of these women\\nI promise they swallow us all\\nI'm firin' at everybody\\nHelicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody\\nAll this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it\\nBoy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody\\nLeave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms\\nCaught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em\\nFree my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him</td>\n",
