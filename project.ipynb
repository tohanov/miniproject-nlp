keep the smoke down\\nOnce it's up, then it's stuck, it can't go down\\nLike to switch where I sleep, I got four houses\\nEvery time the heat come, I make four thousand\\nBig done gave me the game and I ran with it\\nMilk the game 'til I quit, I ain't playin' with it\\nCould've been hit your bitch, I be sparin' niggas\\nMake me mad, I'ma call up them grave diggers\\nBought my mom a new crib, and it's way bigger\\nNever been to it once, that's a great feelin'\\nI'ma go there when I get a chance\\nI lost five hundred racks before I signed a deal\\nSwear to God, I still got my advance\\nYeah, I'm lit, I been savin' this guala up\\nYeah, I hit, but she didn't get a follow-up\\nAin't no reason to beef with no one about none of these women\\nI promise they swallow us all\\nI'm firin' at
